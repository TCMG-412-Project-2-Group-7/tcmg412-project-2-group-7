  <p>Howdy! My name is Alyssa Garcia and I am a senior Technology Managment major from Seminole, Texas. When I am not busy with school, I enjoy golfing, hanging out with my friends, and reading. I am also a part of the women's organization <a href="https://www.alphazetachi.org/">Alpha Zeta Chi</a>, so I do a lot of projects and events with them as well.</p>
